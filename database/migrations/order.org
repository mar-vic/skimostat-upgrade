1) Migrating update_foreing_key_rankings results in General error: 1826
   Duplicate foreign key constraint name 'rankings_participantid_foreign

   - Seems like there is already a constraint with the same name in effect

     - Should I first drop the old constraint or alter the name of the new one?
